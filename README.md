# keylogger
Brief Description:
This keylogger captures keyboard strokes using system hooks. It writes the keystrokes to a log file hidden in,
the AppData folder. This log file is encrypted in case the user somehow locates the log. 
In addition an email can be sent on a timer with the log file attached.
This keylogger is written in C++ and can be used on Windows 7,8,10 machines.
